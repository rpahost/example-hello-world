# Example - Hello World

This example integrates RPA.host, and the new Python open-source framework [robo](https://github.com/robocorp/robo), and [libraries](https://github.com/robocorp/robo#libraries) from Robocorp.

## Tasks

The robot Only has one task. It adds a datafield to the task in your RPA Orchestrator with the text Hello World

## Local testing

For best experience to test the work items in this example we recommend using [our VS Code extensions](https://robocorp.com/docs/developer-tools/visual-studio-code). With the Robocorp Code extension you can simply run and [select the input work items](https://robocorp.com/docs/developer-tools/visual-studio-code/extension-features#using-work-items) to use, create inputs to simulate error cases, and so on.
